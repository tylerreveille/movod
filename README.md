# title of project: movod
# I'm learning how to use github by creating a scheduler program that creates XML and metadata files for VOD content
# In a python shell, run main.py to access the main menu
# This was coded in python 3.7
# This uses a general license
# You will need to download the ico files into a subdirectory of your main file directory in order for the program to run
